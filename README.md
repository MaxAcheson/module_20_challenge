# Solidity Smart Contract Joint Savings Account

This project is a simple Solidity smart contract that establishes a joint savings account controlled by two wallet addresses. Both addresses have the ability to withdraw and deposit funds to the account in the form of Ether. 

## Technologies

This project utilizes `pragma solidity ^0.5.0` and has been constructed on Ethereum's [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) platform.

## Installation and Usage

1. Download the `.sol` file from this repository, found [here](https://github.com/MaxAcheson/module_20_challenge/blob/main/joint_savings.sol).

2. Upload the file to [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/), debug, and deploy.

3. New vanity ethereum addresses must be created for testing purposes. These can be created [here](https://vanity-eth.tk/)

## Contract Functionality
